From a mountain village where epic poems taught me about legacy. Fled to the desert with books and code. Now building for birds, flowers, and future people.

10,000+ hours 🔥 in enterprise projects taught me: complexity is disrespect. Simple solutions are the gift.

Currently: Making software that thinks about becoming, not just doing.
